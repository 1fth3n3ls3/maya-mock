Testing
=======

You can run the test using `test.sh`.
It will take the installed pytest and will inject in into mayapy environment.
You can use any pytest argument and flag with it:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./test.sh ./tests/integration_tests/test_cmds.py::test_listAttr --trace

- Tests in "/tests/unit_tests" are run against the mock.
- Tests in "/tests/integration_tests" are run against the mock AND maya. Test will fail if results are different
- Tests in "/tests/test_hypothesis" are integration tests generated by hypothesis.
